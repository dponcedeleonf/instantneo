## What is InstantNeo?

InstantNeo is a Python library that lets you create LLM-based agents quickly and concisely, designed as components for intelligent systems. It offers a clean, direct interface for granular control over agent behavior, abstracting away provider complexity. Like Neo in *The Matrix* downloading skills instantly, InstantNeo lets you build agents with instant capabilities, simple to start and powerful when composed. Unlike rigid or overly-elaborated frameworks, InstantNeo draws from Marvin Minsky's 'Society of Mind' to deliver modular building blocks, letting you craft multi-agent systems your way.

## Features

**Unified Provider Interface:** Switch seamlessly between models providers with consistent syntax. The library handles different API requirements behind the scenes.
**Quick and powerful Skill Management:** Define agent capabilities using simple Python decorators that transform functions into skills with metadata, descriptions, and parameter validation. Add, remove, and list skills dynamically as your agent's needs evolve.
**Flexible Execution Modes:** Control exactly how skills are executed with three modes: wait for results, fire skills in the background, or just extract arguments without execution for planning purposes.
**Text and Image Support:** Process both text and images through a single consistent API. Send images alongside prompts to vision-capable models and control the level of image analysis detail as needed.
**Customizable Agent Settings:** Modify agent behavior on-the-fly by overriding temperature, max tokens, role setup, and other parameters for specific interactions without recreating the entire agent.

## Installation

```bash
pip install instantneo
```

## Quickstart

### Wake Neo Up

```python
from instantneo import InstantNeo

neo = InstantNeo(
    provider="openai", 
    api_key="your-api-key", 
    model="gpt-4o",
    role_setup="You are Neo, the chosen one. Ready to learn anything."
)

print(neo.run("What's the Matrix?"))
```

### Teach Him Kung Fu

```python
from instantneo.skills import skill
from instantneo import InstantNeo

@skill(description="Execute a kung fu move", parameters={"move": "e.g., dragon punch", "intensity": "1-10"})
def kung_fu(move: str, intensity: int = 5) -> str:
    return f"Hit {move} at intensity {intensity}. I know kung fu!"

neo = InstantNeo(
    provider="anthropic",
    api_key="your-api-key",
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    role_setup="You are Neo, martial arts downloaded.",
    skills=["kung_fu"]
)

print(neo.run("Three agents ahead. What move?"))
```

## API Reference

- **InstantNeo Class**: Set provider, api_key, model, role_setup, plus skills and tuning params (temperature, max_tokens, etc.).
- **run() Method**: Feed it a prompt, pick an execution_mode (WAIT_RESPONSE, EXECUTION_ONLY, GET_ARGS), override settings as needed.

Details in the docs.

## Architecture and Philosophy

InstantNeo leans on Minsky's "Society of Mind": small, specialized agents you connect to make something bigger. Each agent's a tool—give it a role, add skills, and weave them together. The smarts come from your coordination, not ours.
